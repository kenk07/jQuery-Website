			Minecraft is a sandbox video game created by Swedish game developer Markus Persson and released by Mojang in 2011. The
			game allows players to build with a variety of different blocks in a 3D procedurally generated world, requiring creativity from players.
			Other activities in the game include exploration, resource gathering, crafting, and combat. Multiple game modes that change
			gameplay are available, including—but not limited to—a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world
			and maintain health, and a creative mode, where players have unlimited resources to build with. The Java Edition of the game allows
			players to modify the game with mods to create new gameplay mechanics, items, textures and assets
            <br>
            <br>
            Minecraft received critical acclaim and won numerous awards, and has since been described as one of the most influential video
			games in history. Social media, parodies, adaptations, merchandise, and the MineCon convention played large roles in popularizing
			the game.
