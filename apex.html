            Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It was
			released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on February 4, 2019, without any prior announcement or marketing.
            <br>
            <br>
            The gameplay of Apex Legends fuses elements of a variety of video games, including Respawn's own Titanfall series, battle-royale
			games, class-based shooters, and those with evolving narratives[citation needed]. In each round, approximately sixty players in squads of
			three will skydive on to an island, with one player controlling where their squad lands. The teams must then scavenge for weapons and
			equipment in order to fight other players, during which time the play area is gradually constricted in size until only one squad remains
			and therefore wins the match.
