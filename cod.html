            Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision. It is the first installment in the
			Call of Duty franchise,[2] released on October 29, 2003, for Microsoft Windows. The game simulates infantry and combined arms
			warfare of World War II using a modified version of the id Tech 3 engine. Much of its theme and gameplay is similar to the Medal of
			Honor series; however, Call of Duty showcases multiple viewpoints staged in the British, American, and Soviet theaters of World War II.

            The game introduced a new take on AI-controlled allies who support the player during missions and react to situational changes during
			gameplay. This led to a greater emphasis on squad-based play as opposed to the "lone wolf" approach often portrayed in earlier first
			-person shooter games. Much of Infinity Ward's development team consisted of members who helped develop Medal of Honor: Allied
			Assault. The game received critical acclaim and won several Game of the Year awards from reviewers.
